202390387,Pacific Northwest College of Art (PNCA),"The Pacific Northwest College of Art (PNCA) empowers artists and designers to reimagine what art and design can do in the world. This private fine arts and design college, founded in 1909 in Portland, Oregon, offers ten Bachelor of Fine Art (BFA) degrees and six graduate degrees including master of fine arts (MFA) and master of arts (MA) degrees. Dr. Donald Tuski serves as the school's president.\r\n\r\nPNCA is home to the Center for Contemporary Art & Culture which hosts exhibitions with artists such as James Rosenquist and Cauleen Smith. The college welcomes the community in each month for First Thursday arts celebrations showcasing student work and throughout the year with free public lectures by nationally-recognized visual artists, designers, and scholars. The recently launched Make + Think + Code, a center for art and technology, hosts artists- and technologists-in-residence as well as numerous art-tech community events. \r\n\r\nAt PNCA students learn to better understand the work they make and how it can make an impact in the world. Students hone skills and are introduced to entirely new ways of making. Just as importantly, they learn to think critically about their own work and that of others. \r\nPNCA graduates are working artists who show internationally; successful, creative, small-business owners; animators and designers working for top firms such as LAIKA, Nike,  Weiden + Kennedy; professional printers working for studios like Gemini G.E.L.; freelance illustrators with high-profile commissions; and commercial photographers. \r\n\r\nPNCA is an accredited institutional member of both the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) and the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). \r\n\r\nIn addition we are affiliated with the following: Association of Independent Colleges of Art & Design (AICAD)\r\nNational Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU)\r\nArt Resources Consortium Northwest (ARC NW)\r\nOregon Independent College Association (OICA)\r\nFoundations in Art: Theory and Education (FATE)",http://www.pnca.edu,511 NW Broadway,Portland,Oregon,97209,US,45.52695,-122.6781,admissions@pnca.edu,503.226.4391,42

202393659,Red Star Tavern,"* The Definition of Local Flavor\r\n\r\nSince opening its doors in the heart of downtown Portland, the Red Star Tavern & Roast House has treated world travelers and devout regulars to the spirit of the region. That can include literal spirits, like our famous collection of bourbons, scotches and whiskeys, a staff that is genuinely glad to see you, and memorable cuisine that adds a northwest twist to American traditions. Much like Portland itself.\r\n\r\n* Get Comfortable\r\n\r\nIdeally located near Pioneer Square, adjacent to the Hotel Monaco, and not far from where Portlanders get off work, Red Star welcomes folks with a good reason to enjoy themselves. The historic building delivers the timeless ambiance of a true tavern to a contemporary mix of customers. Since introducing a Happy Hour that stretches from 4 — 8 p.m., The Red Star has been the place to meet and unwind. Whether you prefer lively socializing, or sinking into a booth for private conversation, we're here to make you comfortable.\r\n\r\n* Meet Chef Kyle\r\n\r\nExecutive Chef Kyle Rourke took awhile to reach Portland, making stops in Philly, the Jersey Shore and San Diego before bringing his culinary skills and fun-loving attitude to the Northwest. Now he considers himself a local, and you'll find it in the food he serves up: creative interpretations of comfort food favorites, seasonal menus highlighting regional cuisine, and produce purchased as close to Portland as you can get. And his vegan, vegetarian and gluten free dishes aren't just options, their pretty remarkable all by themselves.

We are currently in the process of renovating the building to support a hackerspace, and setting up infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to doing some really cool things in Portland, so come by and see us if you want to be a part of it. ctrlh.org -- meetup.com/CTRL-H",http://ctrlh.org,7608 N Interstate Ave.,Portland,Oregon,97217,US,45.57817,-122.682,jon@ctrlh.org,,39

NW Animation Fest climaxes with a weekend-long marathon through the world’s best new short films, selected from 1400 international submissions. The festival includes after-parties, lobby installations, meeting the filmmakers, more. If you’re an animation-lover, this is the can’t-miss event for 2015.

202395521,Likewise,"During the fall of 2014 Nancy Prior and Adam Moser were looking for a car to buy for an art project that required a vehicle. After calling the number on the for sale sign of a 1964 Ford Ranchero the car's owner, Karen Harding (owner of Cup & Saucer) convinced the two to forget the car and to take over her bar (then Proof). \r\n\r\nGiven two weeks to come up with a concept for the space Prior and Moser decided to create a bar that not only served up great drinks but site specific interactive art projects.\r\n\r\nOpened January 2015, LIKEWISE exists to support artists and their practice. This support comes in a number of ways but primarily LIKEWISE supports artists and their projects through the first ever Bartender in Residency Program - a twist on the traditional art world residency model that employs artists as bartenders who simultaneously implement participatory, socially engaging art works.\r\n\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/158853309",http://likewise.website/,3564 SE Hawthorne,Portland,Oregon,97214,USA,45.51191,-122.6273,,503-206-4884,1

You can download everything from the github page here. It is strongly advised for students to print a copy of the lab handout for easy reference during the workshop.\r\n\r\nBring a laptop running Windows 10 that has wireless network capability. YES, you can use a virtual machine running on your mac or linux computer! Don't forget your power supply! \r\n\r\nDo the following on your laptop:\r\n\r\nEnable Developer Mode\r\nEnable Windows feature “Windows Subsystem for Linux”\r\nMake sure you can invoke a bash shell from a Command Prompt window\r\nInstall Node.js  v6.10.3 LTS from www.nodejs.org\r\nInstall Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition (it's free!)\r\n \r\nCreate a Microsoft Azure subscription. Azure accounts are free for the first 30 days and come with $250 credit.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea to plan on being able to provide your own hotspot connectivity.\r\nPacking an extension cord is often a good idea.\r\nA mouse is often nice too.  \r\n\r\nCOURSE TOPICS\r\nLab 1: Azure Cloud IoT Hub Lab\r\nLab 2: Store Messages to Table Lab\r\nLab 3: Data Visualization Web App Lab\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTOR COMMENTS\r\n\r\nThis is a very cram packed 4 hours, come prepared to learn at a fast pace. Also, understand that this course will not make you an expert in Azure IoT, rather this is a first look at the depth and breadth of the Microsoft IoT technology stack and introduces to some of the major pieces of a typical IoT cloud architecture. You should come away from this workshop with a sense of “knowing what you do not know” and eager to learn more. There are many avenues for learning more and we will wrap the workshop with next steps and learning resources you may wish to explore.

202395905,Scottie’s Pizza Parlor,"PIZZA WITH INTEGRITY\r\nA labor of love\r\n\r\nPizza originated as the food of the people. A simple meal of fresh baked bread topped with seasonal ingredients, a slice would cost a fraction of a cent on the streets of Naples. Hundreds of years after its inception, pizza is without a doubt one of the most popular foods in the world.\r\n\r\nOur intention is to make delicious, well-crafted pizza affordable to all, while ensuring that those who work to put food on your plate can still afford to feed themselves and their families. This is why all our workers earn at least $15 per hour, and why we have a pay-it-forward system that ensures no one leaves here hungry.\r\n\r\nJust like pizza, paying it forward also has Neapolitan origins. A tradition that dates back to the hard economic times during WWII, it began with people buying their morning coffee, but paying for two so that someone else could enjoy a coffee even if they couldn't afford it. The idea has since spread worldwide, and we believe there's no reason it can't work with a slice of pizza instead of coffee. \r\n\r\nWe also just love making pies, listening to music, and talking about ninja turtles.\r\n\r\nScottie's Pizza Parlor is a place where anyone is welcome to grab a slice, have a beer, play some pacman, jam out with us under our disco ball, bring the family, crush a whole pie by yourself, or just hang out at the counter and watch the pizzamaking action!\r\n\r\nSee you at the pizza party!",https://www.scottiespizzaparlor.com/,2128 Southeast Division Street,Portland,Oregon,97202,US,45.50465,-122.6439,scottiespizzaparlor@gmail.com,971-544-7878,1

They become overwhelmed by the enormous amount of information to learn and do not know where to start. To rectify that, we have a group of women speaking who can demystify some of the tools, jargon, and jobs around software:\r\n\r\nPolina Vorozheykina, a software engineer at New Relic, will share her experience entering the industry into a far more senior team of 12 engineers. She will cover useful terminology to know, how to go about asking questions, and how to begin building broad software expertise.\r\n\r\nAshley Puls, a distinguished engineer and architect at New Relic, will cover some useful tools and terminology engineers encounter on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nElisa Binette, a Director of Software Engineering at New Relic, will demystify some of the roles and job titles used in the technology industry. What’s a full stack, front end, or backend engineer? What’s a DBA? What are the key differences between a senior, lead, or engineering manager?\r\n\r\nAfterwards, beginning engineers should better understand common technology terms and the desired skills within each role. They should have a “lay of the land” and feel empowered to go out and learn.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n5:30 p.m. - Doors open\r\n6:00 p.m. - Introduction\r\n6:10 p.m. - Talks begin\r\n7:00 p.m. - Q&A, networking\r\n7:30 p.m. - Event ends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent FAQ\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be gender neutral restrooms?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, there will be gender neutral restrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Is the space ADA accessible?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, the space is ADA accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be food and drink at this event?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, food and drink will be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What is the parking situation?\r\n\r\nA: We recommend taking public transportation—the event is nearby multiple Trimet bus and MAX lines—but there are also paid parking sites close to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Is there any special information that might help me find the entrance?\r\n\r\nA: When you arrive, take the elevators up to the 27th floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Is there secured bike parking?\r\n\r\nA: No, secured bike parking will not be available, but bike racks are located outside the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Should I consider using public transportation?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, public transportation is best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Can I bring my dog?\r\n\r\nA: No, we ask that you leave your furry friend home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\n\r\nPDXWIT is a community-based non-profit organization.

Ignoring the market and speculation of crypto tokens, let's explore how these crypto tokens, notably Ethereum, have improved! Join Scott Bigelow, VP of Engineering at Amberdata (a blockchain data company) in an interactive exploration. He’ll share what cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, are capable above, aside from being bought, sold, and transferred. This session will discuss topics such as \stable\ coins, cross-chain bridges, games, hardware wallets, and more.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n\r\n5:30 pm – Doors open / Networking\r\n6:00 pm - Presentation / Q & A\r\n7:00pm - Networking\r\n7:30 pm - Event ends\r\n\r\nEvent FAQ\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be gender neutral restrooms?\r\n\r\nA: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ: Is the space ADA accessible?\r\n\r\nA: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be food and drink at this event?\r\n\r\nA: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ: What is the parking situation?\r\n\r\nA: We do not have on-site parking.

202396332,"Portland Center Stage at The Armory  128 Northwest 11th Avenue  Portland, OR 97209","Join us for our annual Summer Soiree at The Armory, brought to you by Intel and Cambia Health Solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theme for this year’s Summer Soiree is Social Change in Open Source. It is difficult to break into open source for two key reasons. One, it is community driven technology and many people do not have the time or capacity to do the unpaid work that is often required to get involved. Two, even if you do have the time to contribute, it can be very difficult and even toxic if you are a woman or minority due to harassment by leaders in that space. These barriers, along with so many others that underrepresented folks are facing, make it difficult to have the experience required to obtain sought-after jobs at companies doing open source work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo support this discussion, our conversation starter for the evening is “how can open source be more accessible to underrepresented communities?”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Summer Soiree will feature a panel discussion followed by networking.\r\n\r\nModerator: Dr. Harriet Nembhard, School Head of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University\r\n\r\nPanelist: Sage Sharp is a Diversity and Inclusion consultant and the founder of Otter Tech\r\n\r\nPanelist: Esther John is Director of Software Stacks Engineering in the System Software Products at Intel Corporation\r\n\r\nPanelist: Tara Robertson is the Diversity & Inclusion Strategic Partner for Mozilla\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the event, we’ll have an Activity Table where people can get creative.
