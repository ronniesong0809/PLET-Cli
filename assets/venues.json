Northwest College of Art (PNCA)","description":"The Pacific Northwest College of Art (PNCA) empowers artists and designers to reimagine what art and design can do in the world. This private fine arts and design college, founded in 1909 in Portland, Oregon, offers ten Bachelor of Fine Art (BFA) degrees and six graduate degrees including master of fine arts (MFA) and master of arts (MA) degrees. Dr. Donald Tuski serves as the school's president.\r\n\r\nPNCA is home to the Center for Contemporary Art \u0026 Culture which hosts exhibitions with artists such as James Rosenquist and Cauleen Smith. The college welcomes the community in each month for First Thursday arts celebrations showcasing student work and throughout the year with free public lectures by nationally-recognized visual artists, designers, and scholars. The recently launched Make + Think + Code, a center for art and technology, hosts artists- and technologists-in-residence as well as numerous art-tech community events. \r\n\r\nAt PNCA students learn to better understand the work they make and how it can make an impact in the world. Students hone skills and are introduced to entirely new ways of making. Just as importantly, they learn to think critically about their own work and that of others. \r\nPNCA graduates are working artists who show internationally; successful, creative, small-business owners; animators and designers working for top firms such as LAIKA, Nike,  Weiden + Kennedy; professional printers working for studios like Gemini G.E.L.; freelance illustrators with high-profile commissions; and commercial photographers. \r\n\r\nPNCA is an accredited institutional member of both the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) and the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). \r\n\r\nIn addition we are affiliated with the following: Association of Independent Colleges of Art \u0026 Design (AICAD)\r\nNational Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU)\r\nArt Resources Consortium Northwest (ARC NW)\r\nOregon Independent College Association (OICA)\r\nFoundations in Art: Theory and Education (FATE)","address":"511 NW Broadway Portland, OR 97209","url":"http://www.pnca.edu","created_at":"2008-07-01T02:44:45.000-07:00","updated_at":"2017-06-23T13:42:24.131-07:00","street_address":"511 NW Broadway","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postal_code":"97209","country":"US","latitude":"45.52695","longitude":"-122.6781","email":"admissions@pnca.edu","telephone":"503.226.4391","source_id":996333086,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":true,"access_notes":"","events_count":42},{"id":202390391,"title":"Norris Conference Center‎, Austin","description":"","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln # 365 Austin, TX 78757","url":"http://www.norriscenters.com/Austin/","created_at":"2008-07-03T10:41:48.000-07:00","updated_at":"2008-07-03T10:47:47.000-07:00","street_address":"2525 W Anderson Ln","locality":"Austin","region":"TX","postal_code":"78757","country":"US","latitude":"30.35558","longitude":"-97.73393","email":"","telephone":"512-451-5011","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":null,"events_count":1},{"id":202390413,"title":"Austin Convention Center","description":"","address":"500 East Cesar Chavez Street, Austin TX  78701","url":"http://www.austinconventioncenter.com","created_at":"2008-07-04T09:35:40.000-07:00","updated_at":"2008-07-04T09:37:11.000-07:00","street_address":"500 East Cesar Chavez Street","locality":"Austin","region":"TX ","postal_code":"78701","country":"US","latitude":"30.2622","longitude":"-97.73967","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":null,"events_count":1},{"id":202390414,"title":"Portland City Grill","description":null,"address":null,"url":null,"created_at":"2008-07-04T09:56:24.000-07:00","updated_at":"2008-07-04T09:56:24.000-07:00","street_address":"111 SW 5th Ave #3000, Portland, OR 97204","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postal_code":"97204","country":"US","latitude":"45.52254","longitude":"-122.6755","email":null,"telephone":null,"source_id":996333090,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":null,"events_count":9},{"id":202390417,"title":"Jupiter Hotel","description":"","address":"","url":"","created_at":"2008-07-04T10:00:47.000-07:00","updated_at":"2011-03-06T00:19:21.000-08:00","street_address":"800 E.

the floating-floored Crystal Ballroom \u0026 Lola's Room in downtown Portland, Ringlers Pub is housed in what was once an automotive service garage. How much more convivial it is now! Named for the Crystal's originator -- dance aficionado and entrepreneur Montrose Ringler -- Ringlers features a tall, wooden-beamed ceiling and massive, tiled bar. The crack of pool cues make a merry soundtrack in the cavernous interior. Before or after a concert upstairs, treat yourself to ales from the Crystal's brewery along with some hearty pub fare.

Access to the site is off East Columbia River Highway. It is bordered by the Sandy River on the east, Beaver Creek on the west, and a few residential properties on the south.\r\n\r\nMr. Glenn Otto served the City of Troutdale for many years as a Planning Commissioner, City Councilor, and Mayor. During his tenure of service to the City he negotiated the purchase of Troutdale’s first park site located along the banks of the Sandy River and provided leadership in the creation and improvement of the park.\r\n\r\nThe City of Troutdale wanted to honor Mr. Otto’s illustrious career of devoted service to the City and his vision and guidance in acquiring and developing the riverside park site, so the name of the park was changed from Troutdale Community Park to Glenn Otto Park in 1995.\r\n\r\nFacilities at the park include a caretaker’s home, meeting hall, swimming beach, riverfront access, restroom building, picnic area, children’s playground, and an open play area. In addition to these facilities, there are several small buildings on the site that are used by community organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Sam Cox Building and the covered picnic area can be reserved for parties, picnics, etc., by contacting Rooney Barker at 503-674-7262.","address":"1102 E.

We value all learning and offer experiences in many disciplines, but emphasize the sciences, especially engineering, technology, and health sciences, because of the rapid rate of change in these fields and their essential role in modern life.

Star Tavern","description":"* The Definition of Local Flavor\r\n\r\nSince opening its doors in the heart of downtown Portland, the Red Star Tavern \u0026 Roast House has treated world travelers and devout regulars to the spirit of the region. That can include literal spirits, like our famous collection of bourbons, scotches and whiskeys, a staff that is genuinely glad to see you, and memorable cuisine that adds a northwest twist to American traditions. Much like Portland itself.\r\n\r\n* Get Comfortable\r\n\r\nIdeally located near Pioneer Square, adjacent to the Hotel Monaco, and not far from where Portlanders get off work, Red Star welcomes folks with a good reason to enjoy themselves. The historic building delivers the timeless ambiance of a true tavern to a contemporary mix of customers. Since introducing a Happy Hour that stretches from 4 — 8 p.m., The Red Star has been the place to meet and unwind. Whether you prefer lively socializing, or sinking into a booth for private conversation, we're here to make you comfortable.\r\n\r\n* Meet Chef Kyle\r\n\r\nExecutive Chef Kyle Rourke took awhile to reach Portland, making stops in Philly, the Jersey Shore and San Diego before bringing his culinary skills and fun-loving attitude to the Northwest. Now he considers himself a local, and you'll find it in the food he serves up: creative interpretations of comfort food favorites, seasonal menus highlighting regional cuisine, and produce purchased as close to Portland as you can get. And his vegan, vegetarian and gluten free dishes aren't just options, their pretty remarkable all by themselves.

This presentation will provide valuable lessons learned from practical experience through discussion of material selection, current electronics research and failure analysis case studies.  Design considerations for advanced assembly processes and analytical techniques for materials characterization will also be covered. In addition, a review of lead-free laminate selection and testing procedures will shed some light on the question, “Can your board withstand 9x reflow?” \r\nMembers of the SMTA Portland Chapter are encouraged to bring specific questions or examples of surface mount process difficulties to be shared in an open discussion at the end of the presentation. \r\n•     Major difficulties in lead-free reliability testing \r\n•     Mixed alloy assembly best practices \r\n•     ENEPIG intermetallic formation morphologies \r\n•     PCB plating considerations \r\n•     Analytical testing techniques \r\n•     Root causes of production failures \r\n•     Failure analysis studies — Fine-pitch printing, PoP, 01005 defects and high Tg laminate failures \r\n\r\nDenis C.

Features include Oscar-nominated Song of the Sea, which follows the magical journey of an Irish seal-girl and her brother—and Until Sbornia Do Us Part, a vivacious, tango-driven, comic-fantasy about a romantic musician and a volcanic island that’s floating away from the mainland. The industry showcase offers a glimpse into Oregon’s powerhouse commercial studios, with TV clips, commercials, special effects, and music videos (think Portlandia \u0026 Grimm). Dig deeper into the world of indie animators with eight special topics: family friendly, strange/sexy, computer animation, abstract/psychedelic, films by women, Canadian Oscar winners, NW animators, and Oregon animation history. NW Animation Fest climaxes with a weekend-long marathon through the world’s best new short films, selected from 1400 international submissions. The festival includes after-parties, lobby installations, meeting the filmmakers, more. If you’re an animation-lover, this is the can’t-miss event for 2015. Hollywood Theatre May 4-10, tickets $8-15, festival passes $70.","address":"4122 NE Sandy Blvd., Portland OR, 97212","url":"http://wp.siggraph.org/cascade/2015/04/25/may-5-2015-event/","created_at":"2015-05-03T15:40:39.000-07:00","updated_at":"2015-05-03T15:40:39.000-07:00","street_address":"4122 NE Sandy Blvd","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97212","country":"United States","latitude":"45.53543","longitude":"-122.6207","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":1},{"id":202394945,"title":"Hand Eye Supply","description":"Hand-Eye Supply is a work-focused supply store for creative minds located in Portland, OR.

This private fine arts and design college, founded in 1909 in Portland, Oregon, offers ten Bachelor of Fine Art (BFA) degrees and six graduate degrees including master of fine arts (MFA) and master of arts (MA) degrees. Dr. Donald Tuski serves as the school's president.\r\n\r\nPNCA is home to the Center for Contemporary Art \u0026 Culture which hosts exhibitions with artists such as James Rosenquist and Cauleen Smith. The college welcomes the community in each month for First Thursday arts celebrations showcasing student work and throughout the year with free public lectures by nationally-recognized visual artists, designers, and scholars. The recently launched Make + Think + Code, a center for art and technology, hosts artists- and technologists-in-residence as well as numerous art-tech community events. \r\n\r\nAt PNCA students learn to better understand the work they make and how it can make an impact in the world. Students hone skills and are introduced to entirely new ways of making. Just as importantly, they learn to think critically about their own work and that of others. \r\nPNCA graduates are working artists who show internationally; successful, creative, small-business owners; animators and designers working for top firms such as LAIKA, Nike,  Weiden + Kennedy; professional printers working for studios like Gemini G.E.L.; freelance illustrators with high-profile commissions; and commercial photographers. \r\n\r\nPNCA is an accredited institutional member of both the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) and the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). \r\n\r\nIn addition we are affiliated with the following: Association of Independent Colleges of Art \u0026 Design (AICAD)\r\nNational Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU)\r\nArt Resources Consortium Northwest (ARC NW)\r\nOregon Independent College Association (OICA)\r\nFoundations in Art: Theory and Education (FATE)","address":"511 NW Broadway, Portland OR, 97209","url":"http://www.PNCA.edu","created_at":"2016-09-11T14:35:56.000-07:00","updated_at":"2017-06-23T13:44:29.000-07:00","street_address":"511 NW Broadway","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97209","country":"US","latitude":"45.52695","longitude":"-122.6781","email":"","telephone":"503.226.4391","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":1},{"id":202395365,"title":"Providence Physician Services and Development 1201 NE Lloyd Blvd 5th Floor Conference Room","description":"Providence Physician Services and Development\r\n1201 NE Lloyd Blvd\r\n5th Floor - Conference Room\r\nPortland, Oregon  97232","address":"1201 NE Lloyd Blvd Portland, Oregon 97232","url":"","created_at":"2016-09-12T18:23:53.000-07:00","updated_at":"2016-09-12T18:23:53.000-07:00","street_address":"1201 NE Lloyd Blvd","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postal_code":"97232","country":"US","latitude":"45.52975","longitude":"-122.6532","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":0},{"id":202395367,"title":"Ella Residences","description":"","address":"3833 SW Bond Ave, Portland, OR","url":"","created_at":"2016-09-14T11:43:10.000-07:00","updated_at":"2016-09-14T11:43:10.000-07:00","street_address":"3833 SW Bond Ave","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97239","country":"USA","latitude":"45.49548","longitude":"-122.6709","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":1},{"id":202395368,"title":"Loyal Legion Pub","description":"","address":"710 SE 6th Ave, Portland, OR 97214","url":"http://loyallegionpdx.com","created_at":"2016-09-15T08:41:31.000-07:00","updated_at":"2016-09-15T08:41:31.000-07:00","street_address":"710 SE 6th Avenue","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97214","country":"USA","latitude":"45.5183","longitude":"-122.6594","email":"","telephone":"(503) 235-8272","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":9},{"id":202395369,"title":"Park Square Office Building, 100 SW Market St, Portland, OR (SW Market and SW 1st)","description":null,"address":null,"url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-16T17:23:12.889-07:00","updated_at":"2016-09-16T17:23:12.889-07:00","street_address":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"postal_code":null,"country":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"email":null,"telephone":null,"source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":null,"events_count":1},{"id":202395370,"title":"Barran Liebman 601 SW 2nd Ave, Suite 2300 Portland, OR 97204","description":"Barran Liebman\r\n601 SW 2nd Ave, Suite 2300\r\nPortland, OR 97204","address":"601 SW 2nd Ave, Suite 2300 Portland, OR 97204","url":"","created_at":"2016-09-18T16:05:33.000-07:00","updated_at":"2016-09-18T16:05:33.000-07:00","street_address":"601 SW 2nd Ave","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97204","country":"","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":1},{"id":202395371,"title":"Case Study Coffee Roasters","description":"","address":"802 SW 10th Ave, Portland, OR 97205","url":"http://casestudycoffee.com/","created_at":"2016-09-19T12:22:19.996-07:00","updated_at":"2016-09-19T12:22:19.996-07:00","street_address":"802 Southwest 10th Avenue","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97205","country":"US","latitude":"45.51908","longitude":"-122.6821","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":true,"access_notes":"","events_count":2},{"id":202395372,"title":"Pulehu Pizza","description":"Pulehu : p?.lehu : cooking over an open flame.\r\n\r\nPulehu Pizza specializes in gourmet handmade pizzas.

Our Woodstock Taproom features our New Haven style pizza, sandwiches, salads, brewer-crafted cocktails, and don’t forget the beer…lots and lots of beer…\r\n\r\nLike our Hood River location we try to provide a fun and comfortable atmosphere for everyone who enters. The large windows bring warm glow to the wooden booths, tables, and handcrafted bars. We have two lounge areas that are home to some cozy couches for you to sit back and enjoy a beer. Large open air windows and sidewalk seating are a big hit during the warm summer months. When live bands are not taking the stage in the evenings, relax and listen to the sounds of our ever growing vinyl music collection.\r\n\r\nWe don’t take reservations, come on in and have a beer while you wait. Please check in with the host, give them your phone number and they’ll text you when your table is ready. We will do what we can to seat you as soon as possible.

the fall of 2014 Nancy Prior and Adam Moser were looking for a car to buy for an art project that required a vehicle.

This support comes in a number of ways but primarily LIKEWISE supports artists and their projects through the first ever Bartender in Residency Program - a twist on the traditional art world residency model that employs artists as bartenders who simultaneously implement participatory, socially engaging art works.\r\n\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/158853309","address":"3564 SE Hawthorne Blvd, Portand, Oregon 97214","url":"http://likewise.website/","created_at":"2017-03-19T23:48:14.000-07:00","updated_at":"2017-03-19T23:55:19.000-07:00","street_address":"3564 SE Hawthorne","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postal_code":"97214","country":"USA","latitude":"45.51191","longitude":"-122.6273","email":"","telephone":"503-206-4884","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":1},{"id":202395522,"title":"DevNow","description":"","address":"9 SE 3rd Ave #220 , Portland, OR","url":"","created_at":"2017-03-20T20:52:13.000-07:00","updated_at":"2017-03-20T20:52:13.000-07:00","street_address":"9 Southeast 3rd Avenue","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97214","country":"US","latitude":"45.52272","longitude":"-122.663","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":1},{"id":202395523,"title":"Rogue Eastside Pub \u0026 Pilot Brewery","description":"","address":"928 SE 9th Ave, Portland, OR 97214","url":"","created_at":"2017-03-21T11:11:27.000-07:00","updated_at":"2018-03-12T06:00:03.407-07:00","street_address":"928 SE 9th Ave","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97214","country":"","latitude":"45.51619","longitude":"-122.6565","email":"","telephone":"(503) 517-0660","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":18},{"id":202395524,"title":"Jive Software Suite 200","description":"","address":"Suite 200, 915 Stark Street, Portland, Or","url":"","created_at":"2017-03-21T13:35:49.000-07:00","updated_at":"2017-03-21T13:35:49.000-07:00","street_address":"915 Stark Street, Suite 200","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97205","country":"USA","latitude":"45.52211","longitude":"-122.6804","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":1},{"id":202395525,"title":"Morton’s  Steakhouse","description":"","address":"213 SW Clay Street","url":"","created_at":"2017-03-22T12:35:38.000-07:00","updated_at":"2017-03-22T12:35:38.000-07:00","street_address":"213 SW Clay Street","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97204","country":"US","latitude":"45.5129","longitude":"-122.6779","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":1},{"id":202395526,"title":"Squarespace","description":"","address":"311 Southwest Washington Street  Portland, OR 97204","url":"","created_at":"2017-03-24T21:58:10.000-07:00","updated_at":"2017-03-24T21:58:10.000-07:00","street_address":"311 Southwest Washington Street","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97204","country":"US","latitude":"45.5198","longitude":"-122.6749","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":3},{"id":202395527,"title":"PSU Fourth Avenue Building (FAB) - Room 2500","description":"","address":"1900 SW 4th Avenue Room 2500 Portland OR","url":"","created_at":"2017-03-25T15:40:15.000-07:00","updated_at":"2017-03-25T15:40:15.000-07:00","street_address":"1900 SW 4th","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97201","country":"US","latitude":"45.50955","longitude":"-122.6808","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":1},{"id":202395528,"title":"Brick House Pizzeria","description":"You walk in the door and you feel like you have just come home, with the warm and friendly atmosphere of this “Ma and Pa Pizzeria.” Walk in as a stranger and leave as a friend, as the sign will tell you when you walk in.

We'll provide hands-on experience building a basic “cold” and “hot” path IoT, cloud-based, back-end processing architecture. \r\n\r\nHere's a preview the first event that happened in Charlotte, North Carolina on Monday, June 12th on YouTube: 1st half, 2nd half \r\n \r\nEvery participant attending this event will receive IoT completion certificates.\r\n\r\nWHAT TO BRING \r\n\r\nSince we want to make the most of our time at the workshop, please follow the instructions to prepare for the workshop before arriving. You can download everything from the github page here. It is strongly advised for students to print a copy of the lab handout for easy reference during the workshop.\r\n\r\nBring a laptop running Windows 10 that has wireless network capability. YES, you can use a virtual machine running on your mac or linux computer! Don't forget your power supply! \r\n\r\nDo the following on your laptop:\r\n\r\nEnable Developer Mode\r\nEnable Windows feature “Windows Subsystem for Linux”\r\nMake sure you can invoke a bash shell from a Command Prompt window\r\nInstall Node.js  v6.10.3 LTS from www.nodejs.org\r\nInstall Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition (it's free!)\r\n \r\nCreate a Microsoft Azure subscription. Azure accounts are free for the first 30 days and come with $250 credit.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea to plan on being able to provide your own hotspot connectivity.\r\nPacking an extension cord is often a good idea.\r\nA mouse is often nice too.  \r\n\r\nCOURSE TOPICS\r\nLab 1: Azure Cloud IoT Hub Lab\r\nLab 2: Store Messages to Table Lab\r\nLab 3: Data Visualization Web App Lab\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTOR COMMENTS\r\n\r\nThis is a very cram packed 4 hours, come prepared to learn at a fast pace. Also, understand that this course will not make you an expert in Azure IoT, rather this is a first look at the depth and breadth of the Microsoft IoT technology stack and introduces to some of the major pieces of a typical IoT cloud architecture. You should come away from this workshop with a sense of “knowing what you do not know” and eager to learn more. There are many avenues for learning more and we will wrap the workshop with next steps and learning resources you may wish to explore. Look forward to seeing you at one of these workshops this summer!\r\n\r\nPRIVACY NOTICE\r\nThis event is jointly operated by Microsoft and Hackster.

A simple meal of fresh baked bread topped with seasonal ingredients, a slice would cost a fraction of a cent on the streets of Naples. Hundreds of years after its inception, pizza is without a doubt one of the most popular foods in the world.\r\n\r\nOur intention is to make delicious, well-crafted pizza affordable to all, while ensuring that those who work to put food on your plate can still afford to feed themselves and their families. This is why all our workers earn at least $15 per hour, and why we have a pay-it-forward system that ensures no one leaves here hungry.\r\n\r\nJust like pizza, paying it forward also has Neapolitan origins. A tradition that dates back to the hard economic times during WWII, it began with people buying their morning coffee, but paying for two so that someone else could enjoy a coffee even if they couldn't afford it. The idea has since spread worldwide, and we believe there's no reason it can't work with a slice of pizza instead of coffee. \r\n\r\nWe also just love making pies, listening to music, and talking about ninja turtles.\r\n\r\nScottie's Pizza Parlor is a place where anyone is welcome to grab a slice, have a beer, play some pacman, jam out with us under our disco ball, bring the family, crush a whole pie by yourself, or just hang out at the counter and watch the pizzamaking action!\r\n\r\nSee you at the pizza party!","address":"2128 Southeast Division Street Portland, OR

They become overwhelmed by the enormous amount of information to learn and do not know where to start. To rectify that, we have a group of women speaking who can demystify some of the tools, jargon, and jobs around software:\r\n\r\nPolina Vorozheykina, a software engineer at New Relic, will share her experience entering the industry into a far more senior team of 12 engineers. She will cover useful terminology to know, how to go about asking questions, and how to begin building broad software expertise.\r\n\r\nAshley Puls, a distinguished engineer and architect at New Relic, will cover some useful tools and terminology engineers encounter on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nElisa Binette, a Director of Software Engineering at New Relic, will demystify some of the roles and job titles used in the technology industry. What’s a full stack, front end, or backend engineer? What’s a DBA? What are the key differences between a senior, lead, or engineering manager?\r\n\r\nAfterwards, beginning engineers should better understand common technology terms and the desired skills within each role. They should have a “lay of the land” and feel empowered to go out and learn.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n5:30 p.m. - Doors open\r\n6:00 p.m. - Introduction\r\n6:10 p.m. - Talks begin\r\n7:00 p.m. - Q\u0026A, networking\r\n7:30 p.m. - Event ends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent FAQ\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be gender neutral restrooms?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, there will be gender neutral restrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Is the space ADA accessible?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, the space is ADA accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be food and drink at this event?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, food and drink will be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What is the parking situation?\r\n\r\nA: We recommend taking public transportation—the event is nearby multiple Trimet bus and MAX lines—but there are also paid parking sites close to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Is there any special information that might help me find the entrance?\r\n\r\nA: When you arrive, take the elevators up to the 27th floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Is there secured bike parking?\r\n\r\nA: No, secured bike parking will not be available, but bike racks are located outside the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Should I consider using public transportation?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, public transportation is best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Can I bring my dog?\r\n\r\nA: No, we ask that you leave your furry friend home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\n\r\nPDXWIT is a community-based non-profit organization.

Ignoring the market and speculation of crypto tokens, let's explore how these crypto tokens, notably Ethereum, have improved! Join Scott Bigelow, VP of Engineering at Amberdata (a blockchain data company) in an interactive exploration. He’ll share what cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, are capable above, aside from being bought, sold, and transferred. This session will discuss topics such as \"stable\" coins, cross-chain bridges, games, hardware wallets, and more.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n\r\n5:30 pm – Doors open / Networking\r\n6:00 pm - Presentation / Q \u0026 A\r\n7:00pm - Networking\r\n7:30 pm - Event ends\r\n\r\nEvent FAQ\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be gender neutral restrooms?\r\n\r\nA: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ: Is the space ADA accessible?\r\n\r\nA: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be food and drink at this event?\r\n\r\nA: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ: What is the parking situation?\r\n\r\nA: We do not have on-site parking.

It is hard to know what to expect and even how to prepare for it. Each company evaluates its candidates differently. Luckily, some upfront investment and preparation can really go a long way in helping you distinguish yourself from the rest of the candidates. In this seminar led by an engineering leader at Elemental, we will cover some common interviewing practices for technical interviews and what you may be able to do to get ready. We plan to cover many beneficial topics:\r\n\r\n• Morning preparation, attire, mindset\r\n\r\n• Preparation for the non-technical parts\r\n\r\n• How to study for the coding interview\r\n\r\n• How to execute the coding test\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDue to the level of interaction required, attendance will be capped at 40.

It is difficult to break into open source for two key reasons. One, it is community driven technology and many people do not have the time or capacity to do the unpaid work that is often required to get involved. Two, even if you do have the time to contribute, it can be very difficult and even toxic if you are a woman or minority due to harassment by leaders in that space. These barriers, along with so many others that underrepresented folks are facing, make it difficult to have the experience required to obtain sought-after jobs at companies doing open source work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo support this discussion, our conversation starter for the evening is “how can open source be more accessible to underrepresented communities?”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Summer Soiree will feature a panel discussion followed by networking.\r\n\r\nModerator: Dr. Harriet Nembhard, School Head of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University\r\n\r\nPanelist: Sage Sharp is a Diversity and Inclusion consultant and the founder of Otter Tech\r\n\r\nPanelist: Esther John is Director of Software Stacks Engineering in the System Software Products at Intel Corporation\r\n\r\nPanelist: Tara Robertson is the Diversity \u0026 Inclusion Strategic Partner for Mozilla\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the event, we’ll have an Activity Table where people can get creative. This is a fantastic way to meet others if large groups are not your thing. If you have trouble finding it, look for Meg Aul, our Event Activities Director.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will also have a community partners section featuring amazing organizations:\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen Who Code\r\n\r\nAdelante Mujeres\r\n\r\nGirls Inc\r\n\r\n\r\nHere’s more on our event sponsors:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCambia Health Solutions, headquartered in Portland, Oregon, is dedicated to transforming health care. Our company reaches more than 70 million Americans nationwide, including more than two million people in the Pacific Northwest who are enrolled in our regional health plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntel Corporation’s Women of System Software is an organization of technical professionals committed to fostering an inclusive environment and building a strong community for women and non-binary people in software technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n\r\n5:30 p.m. - Doors open / Networking\r\n\r\n6:30 p.m. - Introductions\r\n\r\n6:45 p.m. - Panel Begins\r\n\r\n7:30 p.m. - Networking\r\n\r\n8:00 p.m. - Event ends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent FAQ\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be gender neutral restrooms?\r\n\r\nA: We do have gender neutral bathrooms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Is the space ADA accessible?\r\n\r\nA: Our spaces are ADA accessible.

There are two entrances to this lot: NW Twelfth Avenue or NW Thirteenth Avenue, between Couch and Davis Streets. The elevators take you into the M Financial Building lobby (just around the corner from the Armory) or into Whole Foods on the corner of Couch and NW Twelfth Avenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Is there any special information that might help me find the entrance?\r\n\r\nA: Entrance is on NW 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Is there secured bike parking?\r\n\r\nA: No designated bike parking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Should I consider using public transportation?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, we recommend public transportation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Can I bring my dog?\r\n\r\nA: Employee pets are allowed through an application and training process.

Most of us don't realize that we got our first job thanks to networking. It was who we knew that needed these jobs done, not what we knew. When it comes to jobs as adults, the same principles apply. Learn how to get to know the right people, grow your network, stand out at networking events, and leverage the people you meet for your next career move with Hannah Michelotti. She is the CEO and founder of Articulate LLC where she does public speaking, presenting, pitching, and communication coaching for clients and businesses.
