1250476517,PDXWIT Presents: How to Navigate the Tech Industry - A Beginners Guide,"***Registration through Eventbrite https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pdxwit-presents-how-to-navigate-the-tech-industry-a-beginners-guide-tickets-86361791443 is required to gain entry to this event ***\r\n\r\nMany people starting out in the software industry experience frustration when work conversations are riddled with acronyms or tech jargon they do not understand. They become overwhelmed by the enormous amount of information to learn and do not know where to start. To rectify that, we have a group of women speaking who can demystify some of the tools, jargon, and jobs around software:\r\n\r\nPolina Vorozheykina, a software engineer at New Relic, will share her experience entering the industry into a far more senior team of 12 engineers. She will cover useful terminology to know, how to go about asking questions, and how to begin building broad software expertise.\r\n\r\nAshley Puls, a distinguished engineer and architect at New Relic, will cover some useful tools and terminology engineers encounter on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nElisa Binette, a Director of Software Engineering at New Relic, will demystify some of the roles and job titles used in the technology industry. What’s a full stack, front end, or backend engineer? What’s a DBA? What are the key differences between a senior, lead, or engineering manager?\r\n\r\nAfterwards, beginning engineers should better understand common technology terms and the desired skills within each role. They should have a “lay of the land” and feel empowered to go out and learn.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n5:30 p.m. - Doors open\r\n6:00 p.m. - Introduction\r\n6:10 p.m. - Talks begin\r\n7:00 p.m. - Q&A, networking\r\n7:30 p.m. - Event ends\r\n\r\nEvent FAQ\r\nQ: Will there be gender neutral restrooms?\r\nA: Yes, there will be gender neutral restrooms.\r\n\r\nQ: Is the space ADA accessible? \r\nA: Yes, the space is ADA accessible.\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be food and drink at this event? \r\nA: Yes, food and drink will be provided.\r\n\r\nQ: What is the parking situation? \r\nA: We recommend taking public transportation—the event is nearby multiple Trimet bus and MAX lines—but there are also paid parking sites close to the event.\r\n\r\nQ: Is there any special information that might help me find the entrance?\r\nA: When you arrive, take the elevators up to the 27th floor.\r\n\r\nQ: Is there secured bike parking?\r\nA: No, secured bike parking will not be available, but bike racks are located outside the building.\r\n\r\nQ: Should I consider using public transportation?\r\nA: Yes, public transportation is best.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I bring my dog?\r\nA: No, we ask that you leave your furry friend home.\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nPDXWIT is a community-based non-profit organization. Our purpose is to strengthen the Portland women in tech community by offering educational programs, partnerships, mentorships, resources and opportunities.

First, in centralized cloud computing, and now as the primary model of edge computing. The industry has put a lot of work into securing these environments against intruders; however, little has been said and less done to protect users against each other and against their own errors. In this talk, Tyler will introduce a new model for functions as a service, explain how it's implemented at Fastly, and talk about how it could change the way we think about end user security.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Tyler McMullen is CTO at Fastly, the leading edge cloud platform, where he is responsible for evolving the system architecture and the company’s technology vision. Tyler leads a team of experienced technology innovators focused on internet scale and working on future-facing, ambitious projects and standards. As part of the founding team at Fastly, Tyler built the first versions of Fastly’s Instant Purging system, API, and Real-Time Analytics.

1250476803,Monkeys in the Machine (Machine Learning),"Food, learning, sharing and encouragement with the fabulous PHP Community!\r\n\r\nThis month Eric Mann presents Monkeys in the Machine\r\n\r\nCan a million monkeys given a million typewriters produce the collected works of Shakespeare? Considering the ethical concerns of forcing monkeys to write, paired with the sheer mess of that many mammals in one location, we might never know. Or will we?\r\n\r\nThanks to the wonders of modern computing, it's possible to _simulate_ monkeys emulating the Bard. Leveraging techniques like genetic algorithms, we can build a system that approximates a monkey armed with a typewriter. Digitally.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun exercise to prove a thought experiment, but also a powerful technical approach to leverage machine learning and rudimentary AI in various places. Together, we'll breed digital monkeys and show both how they can be used to answer the aforementioned Shakespearean question as well as produce generative results to more _practical_ problems.",https://www.meetup.com/PDX-PHP,2020-03-17T18:00:00.000-07:00,2020-03-17T21:00:00.000-07:00,202395308,
