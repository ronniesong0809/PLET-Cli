They become overwhelmed by the enormous amount of information to learn and do not know where to start. To rectify that, we have a group of women speaking who can demystify some of the tools, jargon, and jobs around software:\r\n\r\nPolina Vorozheykina, a software engineer at New Relic, will share her experience entering the industry into a far more senior team of 12 engineers. She will cover useful terminology to know, how to go about asking questions, and how to begin building broad software expertise.\r\n\r\nAshley Puls, a distinguished engineer and architect at New Relic, will cover some useful tools and terminology engineers encounter on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nElisa Binette, a Director of Software Engineering at New Relic, will demystify some of the roles and job titles used in the technology industry. What’s a full stack, front end, or backend engineer? What’s a DBA? What are the key differences between a senior, lead, or engineering manager?\r\n\r\nAfterwards, beginning engineers should better understand common technology terms and the desired skills within each role. They should have a “lay of the land” and feel empowered to go out and learn.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n5:30 p.m. - Doors open\r\n6:00 p.m. - Introduction\r\n6:10 p.m. - Talks begin\r\n7:00 p.m. - Q\u0026A, networking\r\n7:30 p.m. - Event ends\r\n\r\nEvent FAQ\r\nQ: Will there be gender neutral restrooms?\r\nA: Yes, there will be gender neutral restrooms.\r\n\r\nQ: Is the space ADA accessible? \r\nA: Yes, the space is ADA accessible.\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be food and drink at this event? \r\nA: Yes, food and drink will be provided.\r\n\r\nQ: What is the parking situation? \r\nA: We recommend taking public transportation—the event is nearby multiple Trimet bus and MAX lines—but there are also paid parking sites close to the event.\r\n\r\nQ: Is there any special information that might help me find the entrance?\r\nA: When you arrive, take the elevators up to the 27th floor.\r\n\r\nQ: Is there secured bike parking?\r\nA: No, secured bike parking will not be available, but bike racks are located outside the building.\r\n\r\nQ: Should I consider using public transportation?\r\nA: Yes, public transportation is best.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I bring my dog?\r\nA: No, we ask that you leave your furry friend home.\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nPDXWIT is a community-based non-profit organization. Our purpose is to strengthen the Portland women in tech community by offering educational programs, partnerships, mentorships, resources and opportunities. We are unifying a supportive environment for current and potential women in tech, all of whom are committed to helping each other. Our goal is to bring together and empower women in tech and to encourage others to pursue tech careers. This is our step towards reducing the gender imbalance in the industry and addressing the current negative effects of that imbalance on women.\r\n\r\nOur events are inclusive. ALL people who support our purpose are welcome.\r\n","start_time":"2020-02-24T17:30:00.000-08:00","url":"http://pdxwit.org","created_at":"2019-12-16T10:01:16.000-08:00","updated_at":"2019-12-16T10:01:16.000-08:00","venue_id":202392091,"source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"end_time":"2020-02-24T19:30:00.000-08:00","version":null,"rrule":null,"venue_details":"","locked":false,"venue":{"id":202392091,"title":"New Relic","description":"The *27th* floor of Big Pink, three floors down from the City Grill.

First, in centralized cloud computing, and now as the primary model of edge computing. The industry has put a lot of work into securing these environments against intruders; however, little has been said and less done to protect users against each other and against their own errors. In this talk, Tyler will introduce a new model for functions as a service, explain how it's implemented at Fastly, and talk about how it could change the way we think about end user security.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Tyler McMullen is CTO at Fastly, the leading edge cloud platform, where he is responsible for evolving the system architecture and the company’s technology vision. Tyler leads a team of experienced technology innovators focused on internet scale and working on future-facing, ambitious projects and standards. As part of the founding team at Fastly, Tyler built the first versions of Fastly’s Instant Purging system, API, and Real-Time Analytics. Prior to joining Fastly, Tyler worked on large-scale web applications, text analysis, and performance. He can be found debating edge computing, networking, and distributed systems all over the world.\r\n\r\nPlease RSVP here: https://niketechtalksfeb272020.splashthat.com/\r\n\r\nSee you soon!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","start_time":"2020-02-27T16:30:00.000-08:00","url":"https://niketechtalksfeb272020.splashthat.com/","created_at":"2020-02-14T14:40:25.000-08:00","updated_at":"2020-02-14T14:44:41.000-08:00","venue_id":202394785,"source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"end_time":"2020-02-27T18:30:00.000-08:00","version":null,"rrule":null,"venue_details":"Nike World Headquarters\r\nDecathlon Club Café\r\n15350 SW Koll Parkway\r\nBeaverton, OR 97006","locked":false,"venue":{"id":202394785,"title":"Nike Decathlon Club Cafe","description":"","address":"15350 SW Koll Parkway, Beaverton OR 97006","url":"","created_at":"2015-01-08T08:54:40.000-08:00","updated_at":"2015-01-08T08:54:40.000-08:00","street_address":"15350 SW Koll Parkway","locality":"Beaverton","region":"Or","postal_code":"97006","country":"US","latitude":"45.51243","longitude":"-122.8372","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":42}},{"id":1250476808,"title":"BSD Pizza Night","description":"A meeting of folks interested in BSD operating systems and related technologies to get together, eat pizza, drink beer, and talk about what interesting things have been going on.\r\n","start_time":"2020-02-27T19:00:00.000-08:00","url":"","created_at":"2020-02-11T13:54:21.408-08:00","updated_at":"2020-02-11T13:54:21.408-08:00","venue_id":202395069,"source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"end_time":"2020-02-27T21:00:00.000-08:00","version":null,"rrule":null,"venue_details":"","locked":false,"venue":{"id":202395069,"title":"Rudy's Gourmet Pizza","description":"Rudy's Gourmet Pizza!

Our purpose is to strengthen the Portland women in tech community by offering educational programs, partnerships, mentorships, resources and opportunities. We are unifying a supportive environment for current and potential women in tech, all of whom are committed to helping each other. Our goal is to bring together and empower women in tech and to encourage others to pursue tech careers. This is our step towards reducing the gender imbalance in the industry and addressing the current negative effects of that imbalance on women.\r\n\r\nOur events are inclusive. ALL people who support our purpose are welcome.","address":"14204 NE Salmon Creek Avenue  Vancouver, WA 98686","url":"http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu","created_at":"2020-01-24T14:03:02.000-08:00","updated_at":"2020-01-24T14:03:02.000-08:00","street_address":"14204 NE Salmon Creek Avenue","locality":"Vancouver","region":"WA","postal_code":"98686","country":"USA","latitude":"45.72517","longitude":"-122.635","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":1}},{"id":1250476828,"title":"@DAMAPDX Kafka Fundaments with Brian Walter from Confluent","description":"Presented by Brian Walter\r\nConfluent\r\nIncludes a demo and extended Q\u0026A session\r\n\r\nWhen\r\n\r\nMarch 4th, 2020\r\n\r\nSchedule\r\n\r\n8:30 – 9:00 – Snacks and warm-up\r\n9:00 – 10:30 – Presentation\r\n\r\nStandard Insurance Tower Atrium (900 SW 5th, please note Standard Ins. has multiple downtown locations)\r\n\r\nCost\r\n\r\nFree for members (including ALL employees of corporate members)\r\n$15 for non-members\r\n$5 for students with valid student ID","start_time":"2020-03-04T20:30:00.000-08:00","url":"https://damapdx.org/2020/02/12/save-the-date-march-4th-kafka-fundamentals/","created_at":"2020-02-18T10:48:01.192-08:00","updated_at":"2020-02-18T10:48:01.192-08:00","venue_id":202395985,"source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"end_time":"2020-03-04T22:30:00.000-08:00","version":null,"rrule":null,"venue_details":"Standard Insurance Center, 900 SW 5th Ave, Portland, OR 97204, USA","locked":false,"venue":{"id":202395985,"title":"Standard Insurance, Atrium Room","description":"","address":"Standard Insurance, Atrium Room, 900 Southwest 5th Avenue  Portland, OR 97204","url":"","created_at":"2018-07-18T07:35:28.000-07:00","updated_at":"2018-08-30T11:55:42.000-07:00","street_address":"900 Southwest 5th Avenue","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postal_code":"97214","country":"United States","latitude":"45.51699","longitude":"-122.6779","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":2}},{"id":1250476775,"title":"One-on-One Community Tech Appointment","description":"Have a Computer Question?\r\nBook today for one-on-one tech help!

This is a fantastic way to meet others if large groups are not your thing; if you have trouble finding it, look for Meg Aul, our Event Activities Director\r\n-- A PDXWIT volunteer opportunities table\r\n-- A section for job seekers and our sponsors who are hiring, to ensure people get connected\r\n\r\nParents: PDXWIT has teamed up with DivCarePDX to provide caregiver services for kids ages 2-13!

This event has been invaluable to me as I continue to learn best practices and more sophisticated methods for building high-impact analytics at KEEN Footwear.”\r\n\r\nRobert Gillin, Senior Planning Analyst, KEEN, Inc.\r\n\r\n“We had analysts across three different teams attend the symposium. Making those connections has really helped break down silos within our own organization and helped build cross-functional teams. We are seeing a great cultural shift and are already looking forward to the next symposium in June.”\r\n\r\nBen Vega, AVP, Data and Reporting Analyst, Frontline Strategy, Umpqua Bank\r\n\r\n“Attendees can expect to learn something new and valuable that they will be able to implement right away regardless of their experience with Power BI. The Symposium is a fantastic opportunity to learn about specialized topics in less technical areas, such as Power BI adoption strategies and report design considerations, from local and international experts.”\r\n\r\nStephen Gessling, Business Intelligence Developer, NWEA\r\n","start_time":"2020-06-08T14:00:00.000-07:00","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pacific-northwest-power-bi-symposium-tickets-82379626681","created_at":"2020-02-20T09:09:04.000-08:00","updated_at":"2020-02-20T09:22:43.153-08:00","venue_id":202396487,"source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"end_time":"2020-06-08T20:00:00.000-07:00","version":null,"rrule":null,"venue_details":"","locked":false,"venue":{"id":202396487,"title":"The MAC, 1849 Salmon Street, Portland, OR","description":null,"address":null,"url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-20T09:09:04.398-08:00","updated_at":"2020-02-20T09:09:04.398-08:00","street_address":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"postal_code":null,"country":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"email":null,"telephone":null,"source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":null,"events_count":1}},{"id":1250476601,"title":"Open Source Peer Mentoring (Monday Python, for Python JavaScript, Django, React and all open source)","description":"We normally have 12- 24 attendees - some people register on Meetup, others show up every week or see the event on Calagator.
